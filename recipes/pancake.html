    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
      <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>⅓ cup wheat germ</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>5 ⅓ tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 ½ cups buttermilk</li>
      <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a food processor or in a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour,
        white flour, wheat germ or oats, baking powder, baking soda, brown
        sugar, and salt
      </li>

      <li>
        Cut the butter into small pieces with a knife, and add the butter to the
        flour-mixture. Mix until the mixture has a sand-like consistency
      </li>
      <li>
        Make a well in the center of the flour-butter mixture, and add the
        buttermilk and eggs. Stir until the liquids are fully incorporated
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a frying pan over medium heat and grease the surface with 1
        tablespoon of butter or oil. Ladle the batter onto the surface to form 4
        inch pancakes. Once bubbles form on the top of the pancakes, flip them
        over, and cook them on the other side for about 2 minutes
      </li>
    </ol>
